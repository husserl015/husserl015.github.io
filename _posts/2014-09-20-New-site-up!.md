![New]({{ site.url }}/images/new.png) Yes, I've now launced a new version of the site yet again.  This means I've probably been through more versions of the site than I currently have posts but such is life as a techie.

New to this version is that I get deployment from source control, and a better comment system that hopefully will get less spam than the old WordPress one did.  Also it's hosted in Github so I'm hoping that since I'm in Github anyway I'll be more likely to toss out a post or two from time to time.

Please feel free to test the commenting system ;).
