title: Learning HTML5/CSS/JavaScript
---

![Html5](http://achey.net/images/html5.png) I always learn new technologies best through small projects.  With that in mind I’ve started a new projects site called [AcheyNet.AzureWebsites.Net](http://AcheyNet.AzureWebsites.Net) hosted in Windows Azure.  All source code will be publicly hosted through [my Github](https://github.com/damonachey/AcheyNet) account from which the site is directly deployed.

I intend to use this as a portfolio page to showcase some of the things I’ve been experimenting with lately.  Feedback is very welcome.

First up is a minimal implementation of [Klondike solitaire](http://acheynet.azurewebsites.net/klondike/) demonstrating drag and drop, animations, CSS, sprite sheets (sort of), and framework free MVC pattern.
