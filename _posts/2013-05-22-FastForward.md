![>>](http://blog.achey.net/images/fastforward.png) Opera has a neat feature called FastForward that detects ‘next’ links on pages and allows you to use the space bar to not only scroll down, but when the bottom of the page is hit it will automatically advance to the next page for continuous mouse free reading.

This extension brings the same features opera users were used to to the chrome browser.  Please feel free to reply with any questions or problems with the extension.

You can install the extension from [FastForward on the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fastforward/bclfjoomnokgllmiiidbdfjakojplnbo).
